     <h1> CHILDHOOD </h1> 
Catherine always knew she wanted to dance, in fact she knew from just the age of 8 that she wanted to pursue dance as a career. She would train intensively 6 days a week without fail, she was passionate and dedicated therefore quitting was never an option despite the obstacles she faced. Catherine mentions that her only obstacle growing up within the industry would have been people, but this only made her more determined to follow her dreams. Despite Catherine getting into college and studying for her A-levels, her passion for dance soon became apparent even when her biology teacher would allow her extra time to catch up on classes.

          <h1> THE AUDITION STAGES</h1>
          
          Catherine started out at large holiday camp ‘Butlins’ in Minehead where she first started performing. Luckily whilst she was working there, she managed to get an audition for the jazz musical ‘Fosse’ after the famous Bob Fosse. Without knowing how big of a deal and how famous the production is, Catherine found herself not long after in the final stages of the audition and was successful. Before this, she actually went and saw ‘Fosse’ in New York with her dad and said to him “I want to be in that show”. This evidently pushed her even more to pursue herself within the dance industry.

          <h1> GWEN VERDON</h1>
          Gwen Verdon was a choreographer as well as an actress. She was acknowledged in the 50’s and 60’s as ‘the best dancer on Broadway’. Verdon’s success became apparent when she was awarded Tony Awards for her first four starring roles in Can-Can 1953, Damn Yankees in 1955, New Girl in Town in 1957 and Redhead 1959. Verdon was the only daughter and the second child. Her mother had her own dance studio in Culver City which would have helped Gwen hugely. Verdon suffered from rickets as a child, a softening of the bones that often leads to fractures and deformities. Her mother in hope to strengthen Verdon, took her into her own dance classes and eventually enrolled her with a ballet trainor, Ernest Belcher. It was obvious Verdon had a talent when she began to attend dance classes, at just the age of 6 she was billed as ‘the fastest little tapper in the world’. Verdon studied every form of dance: ballet, tap, jazz, ballroom etc.</div>

          <h1> BOB FOSSE</h1>
       <div class="text-yeah4">   Bob Fosse, a trained dancer achieved huge success as a choreographer and director of stage and screen musicals. He won awards for his work with Tony and Academy which includes ‘Pippin’, ‘Cabaret’ and ‘Chicago’. Fosse sadly died from a heart attack in Washington on September 23, 1987. Growing up, Fosse took an interest in dance when he displayed an unusual skill. Both Fosse’s parents supported his interest, enrolling him in formal dance training. By the time Fosse was a teenager, he was dancing professionally in nightclubs where he was exposed to themes of vaudeville and burlesque. Fosse settled in New York City and continued pursuing dance. During this time, he married and divorced twice whilst trying to establish his career. By 1960, Fosse become hugely successful. He decided to take on the role of director as well as choreographer.  Fosse wrote three additional stage musicals before his death. He survived a heart attack before, he however suffered during rehearsals for ‘Chicago’, to write and choreograph the autobiographical film ‘All That Jazz’. </div></div>

     <h1> FAMILY </h1> 
As time went on, Catherine started to get jobs within the dance industry and started to appear in more shows just from handing in her CV but not long after that, her husband was unfortunately diagnosed with a heart condition. This then understandably put everything into perspective for her and she then came to the decision with her husband to start a family together which then turned her career ‘on it’s head’ as everything began to change from this point onwards. When Catherine had her first child, Freddie, she knew from that moment that she couldn’t go back to performing 8 shows every week like she used to. As time passed and Freddie got to one years old, Catherine found her new love for teaching and worked for someone she knew. Although this was good at the time and gave her the opportunity to find her feet within the role, she soon left and started her own school - BKD Performers.

          Catherine would like to see a “future revolution” for her school in the future due to the education system wanting to scrap all of ‘the arts’ such as drama, and dance.
